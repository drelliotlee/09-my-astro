In this project, I will try to build my own pipeline from scratch using:


* Orchestrator: Airflow/astro
    * Using branch operators
    * Using XCOMs
    * 
* (E) Extract : From 2 data sources: a webscrape and a REST API
* (L) Load : Into 3 data warehouses: snowflake and bigquery
* (T) Transform: DBT, in both python and SQL
* Other technologies used:
    * Terraform
    * Docker
